# Password Generator

### A small project inspired by [Dev Samurai](https://github.com/felipefontoura) password generator course.

I made a very simple password generator in the past using the C programming language, and I encoutered the same project, but using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of web development, but it was kinda fun building this one.
